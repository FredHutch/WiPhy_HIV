   The simplest way to compile the required objects and executable is to do the following:

  1. "cd" to the "Linux" directory containing the package's source code and type

  2. If you wish to build the GUI version (hiv_sim_gui) you must set GTKGLEXT environment variable to 
     location of gtkglext installation and the PANGOX variable to the directory containing those libraries.
     Alternatively, you can clone the GIT repository using the command below and set the 
     environment variable to the extra_libs directory contained in it. 

     git clone https://github.com/FredHutch/HSV_models

  3. Load Mesa module (if UBUNTU) - "ml Mesa"

        Depending on your UBUNTU version other modules may also be required including:
        GSL,GLib,GTK+ (2.x),libGLU and Pango (version with pangox)
	This is most easily done using module load commands such as 
	those in the sample setup_env.sh script in the Linux directory.
	You must change the paths to the various directories and source the file.

  4. Type `make' to compile the hsv_sim and hiv_sim_gui (if Linux) executable.

Note: This early version of the C++ program uses GTK+ version 2.x and has not been ported to GTK+ 3.0.
